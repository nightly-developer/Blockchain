ethirium is not just assets it also use for building utilies like apps, network
oracles devices that ate use for bringin real data in for building smart contracts
bloackchain are decentralise hence data should also need to be colected in decentralise way
the smart contracts that interlink decentralise blackchain and offset devices are colled hybrid smart contracts
Features of smart contracts:
1.Decentralized 
2.Transparency & Flexibility
3.Speed & Efficiency
4.Secutiy & Immutability
5.Removal of counterpartyrisk
6.Trust minimized Agreements
